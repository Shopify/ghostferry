Verifiers
=========

Verifiers in Ghostferry is designed to ensure that Ghostferry did not
corrupt/miss data. There are two different verifiers: the
``ChecksumTableVerifier`` and the ``IterativeVerifier``. A comparison of them
are given below:

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------+
|                       | ChecksumTableVerifier | IterativeVerifier           |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------+
|Mechanism              | ``CHECKSUM TABLE``    | Verify row before cutover;  |
|                       |                       | Reverify changed rows during|
|                       |                       | cutover.                    |

|Partial table copy     | Not supported         | Supported                   |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------+
|Worst Case Scenario    | Large databases causes| Verification is slower than |
|                       | unacceptable downtime | the change rate of the DB;  |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------+

.. [1] Additional improvements could be made to reduce this as long as
       Ghostferry is faster than the rate of change. See
       `<https://github.com/Shopify/ghostferry/issues/13>`_.

.. [2] Increase in copy time does not increase downtime. Downtime occurs only
       in cutover.

If you want verification, you should try with the ``ChecksumTableVerifier``
first if you're copying whole tables at a time. If that takes too long, you can
try using the ``IterativeVerifier``. Alternatively, you can verify in a staging
run and not verify during the production run (see :ref:`copydbinprod`).

IterativeVerifier
-----------------

IterativeVerifier verifies the source and target in a couple of steps:

1. After the data copy, it first compares the hashes of each applicable rows
   of the source and the target together to make sure they are the same. This
   is known as the initial verification.

   a. If they are the same: the verification for that row is complete.
   b. If they are not the same: add it into a reverify queue.

2. For any rows changed during the initial verification process, add it into
   the reverify queue.

3. (Optionally, not fully implemented) After the initial verification, verify
   the rows' hashes in the reverification queue again. [3]_

4. During the cutover stage, verify all rows' hashes in the reverify queue.

   a. If they are the same: the verification for that row is complete.
   b. If they are not the same: the verification fails.

5. If no verification failure occurs, the source and the target are identical.
   If verification failure does occur (4b), then the source and target are not
   identical.

.. [3] This can be done a number of times to reduce the number of entries in
       the reverify queue and thus the downtime. Although this is not currently
       implemented. See `<https://github.com/Shopify/ghostferry/issues/13>`_.

A proof of concept TLA+ verification of this algorithm is done in
`<https://github.com/Shopify/ghostferry/tree/iterative-verifier-tla>`_.
