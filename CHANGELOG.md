# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.1 - ?]

### Added

- `PaginationKey` now includes column name

### Changed

- Use `PaginationKey` instead of raw `uint64` for progress report. This means that table progress report will
  include not raw value, but a whole `PaginationKey` object, i.e.
  ```json
  {
    "type": "uint64",
    "column": "id",
    "value": 999
  }
  ```
  which will be in line with the format of state dump. @driv3r #426
